  Hello folks !


This is MikMod, version 3.2.2-beta0, a module player for OS/2.
As usual with each new version, there's a lot of bugfixes and improvements.
Check out the file 'NEWS' for more information.


>> BETA WARNING
---------------

This is a *beta* version of MikMod. Although it should work fine on
almost all systems, there are likely a few last-minute errors or typos
in the source, and some parts have not received enough hours of testing yet.

Also, please note that all features planned for the final 3.2.2 release are not
available yet, and the documentation has not been updated yet.

If I've not scared you, then you can proceed and enjoy fewer bugs than in the
previous version, as well as nice eye-candies (-;


>> BUILDING MIKMOD
------------------

- If you're not building libmikmod for OS/2, then you're lost in the sources.
  Go up one directory, and read the main README file.

So you're on a good old OS/2 system, aren't you ? With a customized Object
Desktop or some equivalent tool collection ?

I hope you've installed REXX support during the system installation. If you
didn't, you lose. Run 'selective install' from the system setup folder, install
REXX support, check it works, and come back here.

This MikMod version can build with either libmikmod 3.1.7/8 (shared library
version 2), or an older version, but all the configuration functions are not
available for older versions.

The first thing you need is to get and compile the libmikmod sound library,
which is not bundled with MikMod anymore !
If you don't know where to get libmikmod, look at the "contact and download
info" section later in this document.

Oh, I almost forgot: you need long filenames to compile MikMod, so you'll
have to compile it on an HPFS drive, or an ext2fs drive, or a network drive
where you can use decent-size filenames.

Currently, MikMod can be build under OS/2 only with the emx compiler
or the Watcom compiler.

In this directory, run 

  configure

The configure script will ask you which compiler to use.

After the configuration has finished and the Makefiles are created, just
run

  make

and you'll get your MikMod binary in the src directory. Just copy the
file ``..\src\mikmod.exe'' somewhere in your PATH, and enjoy !

If the build fails, I'd like to hear from you to correct the problem.


>> USING MIKMOD
---------------

Run MikMod with the ``--help'' parameter to get the available options.
Program documentation is available as an Unix man page (..\src\mikmod.1) which
you can read if you've got a port of the 'man' tool.

Also, after you've run MikMod for the first time, you might want to
customize your mikmod.cfg file, either from the configuration panel or by
editing the file yourself, so you won't need to supply the same options to
MikMod all the time. This file will be created in the directory pointed to by
the HOME environment variable. If you don't have the HOME environment variable,
the file will be created in C:\, which is probably not what you want and should
encourage you to have the HOME environment variable set.

Once you're in the player, if you haven't choosed terse mode (a la
MikMod 2), pressing the H key will give you an help screen with the list
of the keys you can use. I hope it's understandable.

If you used the playlist features of the previous MikMod versions, your
old playlist won't work anymore since the playlist format has changed.
Now the playlist files must have an .mpl extension. To convert your old
playlists into the new format, get an OS/2 port of the Unix 'awk' command
(several exist, including an official IBM version found on DevCon...) and use
the 'convert_playlist' awk script:

  ./convert_playlist < my_old_playlist > my_new_playlist.mpl

I know I'm getting lazy and could have written a REXX script for this, but
it's kinda like reinventing the wheel and I prefer work on the real code.
Hope you won't mind (-:

are in the AUTHORS file for the significative contributions, but some other
