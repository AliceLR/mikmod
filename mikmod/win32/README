This is the instructions to compile mikmod on win32.

Mikmod can be compiler using the lcc-win32 compiler. I have not tested with
other compilers. 

WARNING: I am not an expert in using windows or lcc, but I have
been able to compile mikmod successfully. It is possible that the 
instructions I give here are overcomplicated, or things may not be 
done "the right way". If you have enough knowledge, please feel free 
to write a better readme for the win32 port.

Step by step instructions.

1) First, compile libmikmod, and install it. 

   To install libmikmod, I copied libmikmod.lib (generated
   when compiling libmikmod) in the /lib directory of lcc. 
   Next, I copied the file mikmod_build.h in the /include directory
   of lcc, and renamed it to mikmod.h

2) Compile mikmod
   cd to the win32 directory and type make -f Makefile.lcc

   Hopefully, it will compile and a file named mikmod.exe will be created.

3) Try it! 
   There are 2 audio drivers for window. 
   - DirectSound Driver (Requires DirectX 6)
   - waveform-audio
 
   To choose which driver to use from the command line,
   do a mikmod -n to get the list of drivers and once you
   know the correct driver id, do mikmod -d ?? where ?? is the id.

   do mikmod -h for more command line options.

Good Luck!
