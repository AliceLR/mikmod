This is the instructions to compile mikmod on win32.

Mikmod can be compiler using Microsoft Visual Studio, MinGW, or
Watcom compilers.

1) First, compile libmikmod, and install it.

   To install libmikmod, copy libmikmod.lib (generated when
   compiling libmikmod) in the /lib directory of MinGW. Next,
   copy the file mikmod.h in the /include directory of MinGW.
   Should be similar if you use MSVC or Watcom.

2) Compiling mikmod:

 - using MinGW or MinGW-w64:
   cd to the win32 directory and type make -f Makefile.mingw
   (you need GNU make: gmake, or mingw32-make, or whatever)

 - using MSVC:
   Compile using project files from the 'VisualStudio' directory:
   they are compatible with Visual Studio 2010 and newer.
  (If you really need, the 'VS8' (for MSVC 2005/2008) and 'MSVC6'
   project files are still there, too.)

3) Try it!
   There are 2 audio drivers for windows.
   - DirectSound Driver (Requires DirectX 6 or newer)
   - waveform-audio

   Depending on how you compliled libmikmod, the XAudio2 driver,
   and possibly others may be there too.

   To choose which driver to use from the command line,
   do a mikmod -n to get the list of drivers, and once you
   know the correct driver id, do mikmod -d ?? where ?? is the id.

   do mikmod -h for more command line options.

Good Luck!
