Quick and Dirty Compilation
---------------------------

libmikmod was converted to use CMake ( http://www.cmake.org/ )
starting from version 3.4.0. You'll need to install CMake version 2.8.x
or later from your distribution's repository or from its source
distribution.

Next, run:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake-gui ..         # For the GUI configuration applet

Or:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    ccmake ..            # For the Curses-based configuration applet

With a fallback to:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..             # Non-interactive application.

This will build and install the "libmikmod" shared library and its static
library.

Installing under Win32
----------------------

Consult the CMake documentation for generating a Visual C++ , MinGW32
etc. compatible makefile or project.

Testing
-------

The mikmod/libmikmod test suite is available at:

https://bitbucket.org/shlomif/mikmod-test-suite .

Note that currently it is dependent on system-specific random()/rand()
routines.
