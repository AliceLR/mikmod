INSTALL file for libmikmod
==========================

Starting from version 3.3.2, libmikmod supports CMake.  You'll need to
install CMake version 2.8.x or later from your distribution's repository
or from its source. CMake homepage is at http://www.cmake.org/ .

Run:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake-gui ..         # For the GUI configuration applet

Or:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    ccmake ..            # For the Curses-based configuration applet

With a fallback to:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..             # Non-interactive application.

This will build and install the "libmikmod" shared library and its static
library.

Installing under Win32
----------------------

Consult the CMake documentation for generating a Visual C++ , MinGW32
etc. compatible makefile or project.

Testing
-------

The mikmod/libmikmod test suite is available at:

https://bitbucket.org/shlomif/mikmod-test-suite .

Note that currently it is dependent on system-specific random()/rand()
routines.
